                            These Terms of Use (these "Terms") represent an agreement between you and Pesapeer Incorporated ("Pesapeer") and contain the terms and conditions governing your use of and access to our website at www.pesapeer.com and all affiliated websites owned and operated by us (collectively, the "Website") and our products, services, and applications (together with the Website, the "Services").

                            <br /> <br /> "You" and "your" mean the person who uses or accesses the Services.

                            <br /> <br />"We," "us," and "our" mean Pesapeer Incorporated and its successors, affiliates, and assignees.

                            <br /> <br />"Payment Account" means any source of funds that you may from time to time use for the funding of your Pesapeer Wallet, including a bank account or debit or prepaid card account. The Payment Account must be issued or held in your name at a depository institution in your country.

                        <h4>THE AGREEMENT</h4>
                        <p className='small text-muted pb-0'>Your use of and access to the Services are subject at all times to these Terms and our Privacy Policy. Please read these Terms and our Privacy Policy carefully. By using or accessing the Services, you represent that you have read and understand these Terms and our Privacy Policy, and you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of these Terms and our Privacy Policy, do not use or access the Services.

                            <br /> <br />Subject to the terms of the Agreement, we agree to provide the Services to you using reasonable care. You may use the Application only to send a Remittance to a Recipient located in a country where Pesapeer’s payment services are provided (this will be designated on the Application from time to time). The funds will be made available for receipt by the Recipient after remittance has been processed by Pesapeer and its designated service providers.

                            <br /> <br />A Pesapeer Wallet is set up by registering on the Website and then taking all the additional steps including verifying your email address, phone number, BVN, identity and other additional steps as we may deem necessary in the future. Where this service is available in your country, you can fund your Pesapeer Wallet directly from your bank app using Interac, for free, or by using such other methods as we may make available from time to time. After your Pesapeer Wallet has been funded, enter your preferred transfer amount, choose a Recipient and send money.

                            <br /> <br />You must not use the Services in connection with illegal activity including but not limited to money-laundering, fraud and the funding of terrorist organisations. If we reasonably believe you are using the Portal or our Services in connection with illegal activity or for any fraudulent purpose, or are permitting a third party to do so, we are obligated to report you to the appropriate legal authorities.

                            <br /> <br />No fiduciary or escrow relationship is created between you and Pesapeer as a result of your use of the Service. Pesapeer provides a remittance service only; the funds that you direct Pesapeer to pay to your Recipient are not held by Pesapeer as a deposit or in escrow, and Pesapeer is not holding or processing your Remittance as a fiduciary. Pesapeer's only obligation is to pay your Remittance to your Recipient or to return the principal amount of the Remittance to you.

                            <br /> <br />The Service is generally available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, although there may be times when the Service is unavailable to you or to your Recipient. Periods of unavailability may be caused by Pesapeer's own acts (such as temporary periods when the Service is taken off-line to make upgrades or improvements), or by events beyond Pesapeer's control, such as power outages, telecommunications failures, war or civil unrest, natural disasters or other acts of God. Pesapeer may from time to time set limits on the value of Remittances you may send (both individually and over a period of time), as well as the value of Remittances any Recipient may receive. Pesapeer may delay payment of your Remittance to allow Pesapeer to determine that your Remittance complies with applicable law, regulation or Pesapeer policies. Pesapeer has the right, without notice to you, to refuse to accept or pay any Remittance that Pesapeer determines in our sole discretion may violate applicable law, regulation or our policies, including laws, regulations and policies intended to help detect and prevent money-laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, and other abuses of financial services; if we accept a Remittance and then determine that it may violate any such law, regulation or policy, we may hold the Remittance until such time that the matter is resolved.</p>

                                    be a resident of any origination country approved by Pesapeer and have a Payment Account in your name in the approved origination country; and
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    provide all information requested by us, such as your full name, address, email address, telephone number, occupation, location, date of birth, means of identification, personal description, photograph, online credentials for your Bank Account, and such other information or documentation as we may request from time to time that will allow us to verify your identify (collectively, "User Information").
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            You will choose a user identifier, which may be your email address or another term, as well as a password. You may also provide personal information, including, but not limited to, your full name, address, email address, and telephone number. You agree not to create more than one registration without our prior written permission. You are responsible for safeguarding your password and other User Account information. You agree not to disclose your password to any third party and you will notify us immediately if your password is lost or stolen or if you suspect any unauthorized use of your User Account. You represent and warrant that all User Information you provide us from time to time is truthful, accurate, current, and complete, and you agree not to misrepresent your identity or your User Information. You agree to promptly notify us of changes to your User Information by updating your Pesapeer Account; provided, however, that you must notify us at least three Business Days before any changes to your Bank Account information, including, but not limited to, the closure of your Bank Account for any reason by emailing support@pesapeer.com or by updating your Pesapeer Account via the Website. If we approve your registration, you will be authorized to use the Services, subject to these Terms. Providing false or inaccurate information or using the Website or Services to further fraud or unlawful activity is grounds for immediate termination of this Agreement.

                            <br /><br />Pesapeer’s ability to verify your identity is important to your use of the Service, you therefore authorize Pesapeer to obtain information about you from third parties (including financial institutions and credit reporting agencies), although Pesapeer has no obligation to do so. We reserve the right to prohibit you from using the Service or to stop your requested Remittance if you do not provide accurate and complete information during registration or when requesting a Remittance. Inaccurate and/or incomplete information provided by you during registration or when requesting a Remittance may cause errors in your requested Remittance or may delay or restrict your access to the Service.</p>
